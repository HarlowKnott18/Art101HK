        <h1>Hello World :D</h1>
        <img class="photo" src="./img/Photo on 4-13-24 at 4.00 PM.jpg"
        <p>Hi folks! We are Maya Pahre and Harlow Knott and we are partners for this rad project.
             We both do not have a lot of coding experience, but we are excited to learn. 
             Maya is an art and game design double major and loves to draw, listen to music, 
             and go thrifting. Harlow is an art and psychology double major and loves digital illustration,
             painting, watching cartoons, and CATS! We met through a mutual friend in this class, who happens
             to also be named Maya! We love to work together in this class because we are both creative
             individuals with a passion for the arts. Thanks for stopping by! </p>

                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p>The challenges of this lab were figuring out how to link our code to our website,
                    to create changes. We also had to learn how to work and code together as a team
                    on this project. Learning new software, such as VS code, HTML, and CSS were difficult,
                    but proved to be very rewarding! .</p>

                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p>We first had to figure out how to get our InstallFest repository working in VS code. After
                    we figured that out, we struggled to make our changes in the code appear on our website. While using CSS 
                    we had to trouble-shoot a lot of commands in order to get the outcome that we wanted. We also had a problem 
                    uploading our image, but were able to use Wesbot to figure it out. Wesbot is our Westie, which is Wes Bestie.</p>

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>This assignment has been successful. We have learned how to change the appearance of our 
                    website, as well as the text and format included. We put a lot of energy into this assignment because
                    this is all new information for us, but we were able to work together to figure it out. We did additional research to customize
                    multiple aspects of our website, like the image we added and the background color. </p>

                <h2>Results</h2>
                <p> We are very pleased with our website. It is functional, informative, and aesthetically pleasing to look at.
