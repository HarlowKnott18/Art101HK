				<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to experiment with DOM manipulation. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We honestly didn't have a lot of problems with this lab! We first struggled with making our button work,
					   but we realized that we needed to add the new text generator and the appended output within the brackets of our
					   function so that they get linked together. Once we put them in the same "{}" we saw that our button worked. We then struggled
					   with customizing our button, but we realized that we linked our CSS with the word "combo" instead of "convo". Once we
					   fixed that, it worked and we were able to customize our button and the text.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab went pretty well! A lof of our mistakes came from small errors that were relatively easy to fix. We had a few formatting errors,
					   but once we figured this out we were able to edit it and fix our code. We also had to make sure we had no spelling errors as well. Overall,
					   this lab was fun and informative!

					<h2>Results</h2>
