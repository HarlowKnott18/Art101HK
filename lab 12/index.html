			<h1>Lab 12 - Conditionals</h1>

				<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to create a function that depends on conditionals. More specifically, we made a function that takes ones input and sorts them into a harry potter house
					   based on said input. 
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We didn't have too many issues with this lab! Our main issue was with making sure our input actually created an output. At first, our button didn't work but we realized that it was simply
					   a formatting error, as the code for this lab required a very precise input, but once we realized our errors we were able to get our lab up and running. We also struggled a bit with putting our gif
					   on our page as it kept covering up our bottom input and output, but we realized that we needed to shrink the margin on our CSS and the parameters of our image which allowed it to fit nicely on the screen.
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab went pretty well! It was fun being able to test what our house would be... even though it got our houses wrong. We tried to make our website harry potter colors and had fun looking for a gif for this project.
					   It was cool to learn how to take input and make a generated output and we learned conditional functions successfully through this lab. Our biggest problem was with the tiny details within the code, but we were able to correct
					   our mistakes.
