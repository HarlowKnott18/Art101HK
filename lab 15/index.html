<div class="minor-section">


<h2>Challenge</h2>
<p>The challenge of this lab was to figure out how to code an API using jQuery and AJAX.
</p>
</div>

<div class="minor-section">
<h2>Problems</h2>
<p>We didnt have much of a problem with the HTML and CSS as weve been doing those for quite a while now. 
But we did have a bit of difficulty figuring out how to make our javascript for the API link to our button and html.
We also had a bit of difficulty with doing the CSS for our button. However, with a bit of help from chatGPT
we were able to get it fully working! 
</p>

<div class="minor-section">
<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p> This lab was a bit dificult when it came to making our API work, but other than that it was pretty easy to do!
</p>
</div>

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Below we have the results of our yes/no API </p>
