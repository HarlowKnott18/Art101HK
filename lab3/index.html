			<h1>Lab 3 File Structure and File Transfer- </h1>
			
			</p>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Creating a file structure didn't prove to be too difficult, but figuring
						out how to put my links on the website, as well as making sure they worked, 
						proved to be a challenge.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The main problem that I encountered was making sure all of my coding actually worked 
						on my webpage. I would put in specific codes and they would not transfer onto my cite and
					    I had to troubleshoot what I did wrong.  </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I think this lab went pretty well! Lab 2 helped prepare me for this lab, but I still
						had to refresh my memory on certain coding commands. I put a good amount of effort into 
					    assignment to make sure that my websites are cohesive and functional. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Well take a lookie over here! It's my screenshots of my efforts and my 
						file structure that I made! YAY!
